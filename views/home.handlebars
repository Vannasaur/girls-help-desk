<h2>You may filter tickets by Status, or view ALL.</h2>

<div class="button-card">

{{!-- The top portion of the page is dedicated to several buttons. On click, these buttons will filter the table view to
only include tickets which match the selected status. They will function as links which take the user to /:status?
All - takes the user to /
Open - takes the user to '/Open'
Pending - takes the user to '/Pending'
Resolved - takes the user to '/Resolved'
Claimed - takes the user to '/Claimed'
When any of these paths are applied to the URL, the user will always see the Dashboard page, but their ticket table will
be filtered to only match the tickets by that status. --}}
